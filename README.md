## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
   -  The Name, Email or Message fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
   -  The Email is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
-  Bonus: View actual locations on the contact page map (we recommend Leaflet JS for this)
