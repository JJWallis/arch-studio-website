# Frontend Mentor - Arch Studio multi-page website solution

This will be a solution to the [Arch Studio multi-page website challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/arch-studio-multipage-website-wNIbOFYR6) on Frontend Mentor

> For now I am currently using this repo to practice tasks on Leetcode to improve my problem solving skills

## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
   -  The Name, Email or Message fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
   -  The Email is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
-  Bonus: View actual locations on the contact page map (we recommend Leaflet JS for this)

-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Sass - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

### Continued development

I feel like my confidence is increasing when tackling the 'easy' questions listed on Leetcode, although I do still feel there's a significant jump to the next level of difficulty. I look forward to pushing myself further by attempting these harder challenges because these style of questions really help open my eyes to all the different approaches one can take to solve a problem, as well as considering the time and space complexity of that approach.

### Useful resources

-  [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - Leetcode is an amazing resource of useful algorithmic style questions that one use to improve their problem solving ability. I appreciate the fact that I can also view other developer's solutions to compare and contrast my approach.
