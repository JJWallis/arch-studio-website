// isLeapYear(strOfYear) + returns true or false
// leap year = divisble by 4 without remainder (occurs every 4 years)
// except for century years that are not divisible by 400 (ex: 1700 = false return)
// but not when century years are divisible by 400 (ex: 1600 = true return as still a leap year)
