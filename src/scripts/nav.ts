// OOP Style
// easy to `understand` vs `maintainable` code vs shortest method
// Understand problem (repeat it with diff words) - Asking `clarifying` questions (unclear requirements + edge cases)
// devise a plan - take lager issue + break down into smaller
// execute plan - from outline of plan via comments
// what do I currently know
// review solution - better approach? + `refactor` for readability, extensibility, re-usability, and performance

//On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi].
// Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.
// You can move according to these rules:
// In 1 second, you can either:
//  move vertically by one unit,
//  move horizontally by one unit, or
//  move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
// You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
// You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.
